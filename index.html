				<p align="justify">
					Eva is a Java OOP implementation of an <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm"
						title="Eva wiki" target="_blank"> evolutionary algorithm</a>,
					which is a concept from the field of artifical intelligence. It can
					help solve complicated problems that otherwise would require very
					much computational effort to be solved.
				</p>
				<h3>Examples of problems that can be solved:</h3>
				<ul class="dash">
					<li>The backpack problem</li>
					<li>The salesman's problem</li>
					<li>... and really any other problem for which you can <br />
						formalize the solution, solution generation and solution
						evaluation,<br /> in such a way that Eva can understand (see Usage page).
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>How does it work?</h3>
				<p align="justify">First, a number of possible solutions is generated and evaluated (evaluating a solution means saying how good, or how "fit" it is).
				Based on these solutions, with each iteration, it tries to create better solutions by changing and combining the existing ones until finally, a solution is chosen to be the answer. 
				The algorithm runs until certain conditions are met, like:</p>
				<ul class="dash">
					<li>number of iterations (implicit)</li>
					<li>time consumed</li>
					<li>a solution with a minimal "fitness" was found etc.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Wait, what?</h3>
				<p align="justify">
				From the simplicity of the above paragraph, you might have guessed that Eva is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic" title="heuristic wiki">heuristic</a>, rather than an algorithm. It's called an agorithm in AI, because
				it tries to follow the evolving steps of living organisms (if you dig deeper in the theory, you will find words like "chromosome", or "mutation").</p>
				<div class="mlr15">

				</div>
				<p align="justify">In other words, run it with the same input multiple times and you most likely won't get the same output. Also, based on the conditions you set,
				you might get a very satisfying solution, or one that is very bad.</p>
				<p align="justify">Having this in sight, you must know not to use this method where both precision and speed are required. 
				Depending on your problem, you might guarantee a satisfying result by specifying appropriate stopping conditions, but that takes 
				away the speed. For a big input and strict conditions, it can take a lot of time for the algorithm to end - this is influenced also by the machine's specifications, of course.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="usage" class="pageContent" style="display:none;">
				<h3>Light maven dependency</h3>
				<p align="justify">The library comes as a lightweight maven dependency. To start using it,
				simply add <a href="#">this dependency</a> into your <code>pom.xml</code></p>
				<h3>Needed implementations: </h3>
				<p>Eva expects concrete implementations of a few abstractions that are used. Things that can't come out-of-the-box (they are specific to each problem)</p>
				<ul class="dash">
					<li>A <code>Representation</code> for a <code>Solution</code>. How does a solution to your problem look like?</li>
					<li>Define what a solution's <code>Fitness</code> is and how it's calculated.</li>
					<li>How does a solution <code>mutate</code> (change its representation) and how do 2 solutions create another.<br/>
					Be creative here and try to predict the behaviour of a solution. This part is actually the engine of everything and
					can make a big difference in the performance of the algorithm!</li>
					<li>How is a <code>Solution</code> created? The algorithm starts off by creating a number of solutions
					to work with, so you need to provide a generator of solutions.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Example implementations</h3>
				<p align="justify">Look in the package <a href="#">com.amihaiemil.eva.ex</a> to find implementations that can be used in solving the
				backpack's problem. Also, taking a look in the unit tests will surely help you get a good grip of how to
				use this library.</p>
